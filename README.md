# Choice-Paradox
Mumbai Housing Data Analysis : Decisions for investment, buying and selling of properties depend upon the market value of that property. Issues arise in arriving at the actual value of the property as well as computing threats of returns from the estate. Addressing valuation related issues through an understanding of behavior

Software Requirement:
● Browser: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave
● Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, Microsoft Excel
● IDE: Python 3.5

Description of Tools Used
1. Google Colab Notebook: Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary
Python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning,
data analysis and education.
2. Pandas: Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and
intuitive.
3. Numpy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adds support
for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of
high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
4. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and
interactive visualizations in Python.
5. Seaborn: Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will
be used to visualize the random distribution

Figure 1: Price v/s Location

In the above figure we can see the direct correlation between price and location. More
popular areas have influence on property rates. The relationship established here is that prices
are directly proportional to location. the more developed area the more the prices of houses.
* Price α location


Figure 2: Location v/s price per sq. ft
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec6e367-085c-4473-9527-773ad566787a)

In the above figure we can see that the price per sq. ft is directly related to location. As we
move more towards the sea and south, the price per sq.ft tends to increase in multiples. In the
specific location the areas which have sea view etc.


Figure 3: price v/s swimming pools
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/721d6695-49cc-4ea2-9dd9-8d64b3de5f49)

In the above figure we can see that whether the property has a swimming pool or not the
prices do not have much impact. So here we can conclude that swimming pools do not play
much role in the price of property.


Figure 4: price v/s security and parking
[image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26239558-e7c8-4d11-9313-d4d20b161f54)

In the above diagram we can see that all day security and parking are factors that directly
affect the price of property. Properties with both these facilities tend to have higher prices
than properties without them.


Figure 5: price v/s gas, lifts
[image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e510be02-48b5-4e1a-a8b5-ec2eee898c0b)

In the above figure we can see that properties which have gas connections and lifts are higher
in price.


Figure 6: price v/s jogging track, gardens
[image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/676f5a74-0d9b-41af-8f0a-cca2ba49b913)

In above figure we can see that price is not much affected with jogging track and gardens
